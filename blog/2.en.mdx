It's been almost a week since Snoreman launched, and I'm thrilled this app has become a small business while helping me solve my snoring problem.

## Future Potential: How Big Can This Get?

For reference, the established player in this niche, **SnoreLab**:

* **Estimated Annual Revenue:** $2.4M - $3M
* **User Base:** Over 15 million subscribers at $10/month

With continuous optimization and getting more people to know about Snoreman, this could become a product that supports a small team.

My roadmap for improvement:
- Build social media presence for consistent sharing
- Partner with KOLs/influencers
- Vibe-code new features to surpass competitors in capability and UX

## Lessons from Week One

* **Build something you want:** The world is vast. If you need something, others likely do too—you just need to find them.
* **Stay minimalist:** Every increase in project complexity adds maintenance cost. Don't over-engineer if you want long-term survival.
* **Community power:** Communities are essential for exchanging ideas and acquiring early adopters. I learned to invite readers to join the community at the end of every blog post.
* **AI is a marketing superpower:** Posting to Reddit's r/snoring based on AI suggestions yielded unexpectedly great results.
* **Charging is validating!** Don't fear charging. Only when users pay does it prove you're delivering real value.
* **Keep promotions simple:** When running campaigns, direct and simple rules work best—don't make users jump through hoops for rewards.
